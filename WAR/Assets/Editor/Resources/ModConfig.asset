  description: "The timer triggers the PTSD of two people. Peppino, since he has a
    fear of running out of time; and the defuser, since he has a fear of running out
    of time.\r\n\nSolve mods so that the WAR timer doesn't reach 0.\n\nObvious credits
    to McPig for Pizza Tower existing.\n\nThe manual can be found in the manuals folder
    of the game or at ktane.timwi.de.\n\r\nContact Fartlicker777#9169 on Discord if
    there are any bugs."
